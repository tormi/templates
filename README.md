# Templates

## Drupal 8

### Core

<https://www.drupal.org/project/drupal/issues/2982680>:

> Drupal.org now provides "starter" Composer project templates that can be used to start new Composer-managed sites.

> - Use `composer create-project drupal/recommended-project` to create a site where the Drupal root has been relocated into a `web` subdirectory.
> - Use `composer create-project drupal/legacy-project` to create a site where the Drupal root is in the top-level directory, with the `vendor` folder.
